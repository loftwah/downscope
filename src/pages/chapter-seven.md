## DOWNSCOPE - CHAPTER 7: THE NEW NORMAL (Revised Scene)

**(Context: Same as before - Infrastructure team's weekly co-location session, post-restructuring.)**

### Scene: The Phishing Simulation Incident (Take 2: Now with More Incompetence)

The usual focused hum filled the "Eagle" conference room. Max was elbow-deep in optimizing vector index parameters, Sarah monitored Aether's heartbeat, Eli crunched performance data, Jules reviewed compliance logs, Emma presented user analytics remotely, and Rhys observed the ecosystem he was cultivating.

Suddenly, Max let out a noise that was less a word and more a strangled sound of pure disgust. "Oh, come *on*." He stabbed violently at his trackpad.

"Phishing sim got you?" Jules asked, recognizing the tone.

"It's not just the sim, it's the sheer, weapons-grade *stupidity*!" Max spat, turning his laptop with unnecessary force. The email was displayed: Subject: `Urgent: Security Policy Update Required Your Validation`. Sender: `Innovate Security Awareness Team <security@inovatesolution.com>`.

"Okay, `inovatesolution.com`. Missing the 'n' and the 's'," Sarah observed. "Another typo sim."

"No, no, no," Max said, his voice rising, already pulling up a terminal window alongside the email. "That's not the *point*. We *know* SecOps owns `innovatesoluition.com` – missing the 't' and 's'. They registered that obvious typo ages ago, like they're supposed to!" He typed rapidly. "So I see *this* steaming pile from `inovate`-fucking-`solution.com` and think, 'Who the hell registered *this* variant?'"

He hit Enter, and the `whois` results filled the terminal screen. He jabbed a finger at the registrant details: `SecureAware Training Services LLC`.

"The *vendor*! The *same vendor* running the simulation!" Max threw his hands up, exasperated. "Our own security team blocks the obvious typo, doing their damn job, and then this shower of fucking clowns we *pay* goes and registers *another*, slightly different, arguably *more* confusing typo domain? Did they even *talk* to our SecOps team? Did anyone coordinate this exercise in redundant idiocy?"

His voice took on a sharp, cutting edge, reminiscent of a certain Finnish kernel developer berating substandard code. "So now we have *two* slightly wrong domains floating around. One owned internally as a defensive measure, and one owned by a *vendor* actively using it *against us* in simulations! How is that enhancing security? It's actively muddying the waters! It's training people that slightly-off domains might be legit because the *official training* uses them!"

He wasn't done. "And *of course*, the reporting mechanism is still broken on mobile! Saw it on my phone first, looks perfectly real, no way to report it via the add-on. So you can't even correctly fail people who spot this crap on the go! It's incompetence layered on incompetence!" He finally leaned back, shaking his head. "Fuck you, SecureAware Training Services. Just... *fuck you* for being this negligent with our brand and our security posture under the guise of helping."

Jules nodded slowly. "Okay, that's significantly worse. Owning `inovatesolution.com` when `innovatesoluition.com` is already secured internally... that's not just bad practice, it's indicative of zero communication or coordination between the vendor and our own security function."

"Creates conflicting signals," Sarah stated flatly. "Increases the chance of real threats using similar tactics being dismissed or mishandled. Raises questions about vendor oversight."

Eli offered his succinct assessment. "Vendor action duplicates internal mitigation effort inefficiently while introducing ambiguity. Process failure."

Rhys, who had listened without interruption, finally spoke. His tone remained level, analytical. "The lack of coordination between the vendor's campaign execution and internal domain security posture represents an operational inefficiency. The vendor likely operates with standardized playbooks that don't integrate sufficiently with client-specific contexts." He tapped his tablet. "The failure of the mobile reporting mechanism remains the most quantifiable metric deficiency in *our* visibility of the training's effectiveness. I will ensure feedback regarding *both* the domain registration redundancy *and* the mobile reporting limitations is relayed to the CISO's office for vendor management review."

Max scoffed, turning back to his screen, though the explosive peak of his anger had passed, leaving behind simmering resentment. "Vendor management review. Right. Translation: it'll go in a report nobody reads until a *real* incident happens using that exact domain."

The moment passed. The team returned to their tasks, the incident absorbed into the background radiation of corporate life. But the absurdity hung in the air – a paid security vendor actively undermining security hygiene through sheer, uncoordinated incompetence. It was, as Max had implied, profoundly stupid. And nobody seemed empowered, or perhaps bothered enough, to fix it immediately.
