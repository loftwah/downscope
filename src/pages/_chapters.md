**Revised Recommendation:**

Still aiming for **approximately 14 to 16 total chapters**. The added scene details provide more concrete content for the existing structure.

**Revised Rough Potential Structure (Incorporating New Scenes & Feud Details):**

*   **Chapters 7-9 (Rising Action - Public Escalation & The Challenge):**
    *   Aether Phase 2/3 development continues under increasing pressure (internal milestones, external market).
    *   Jax Thorne escalates *public* attacks on X/Twitter, specifically citing Aether's capabilities (maybe based on leaks/assumptions) as proof of IP theft from Nexus Mind, possibly sharing flawed technical comparisons.
    *   **Banger Scene:** **Max Murphy engages publicly on X/Twitter, delivering a technically sharp, multi-tweet takedown** of a specific flawed claim made by Jax, showcasing Infra's confidence and technical superiority (potentially guided/approved by Rhys).
    *   **Minor Beat:** Jesse Chen potentially amplifies Max's points or tries independent (less effective) defenses, perhaps drawing unwanted troll attention or requiring Sarah's guidance on public comms.
    *   **Banger Scene:** **Showcase an Infrastructure co-working session at WeWork featuring the "Phishing Sim Incident,"** highlighting team dynamics (Max's rage, Eli's analysis, Sarah's pragmatism, Rhys's detachment) and background corporate friction *while* the Dataprime feud simmers externally.
    *   **Pivotal Moment:** Jax Thorne, fueled by the public back-and-forth and potentially Max's online jabs, **issues the public boxing challenge** via X/Twitter/video, explicitly framing it as a way to settle the IP dispute ("Prove you didn't steal it, fight me"). Directly tags Mark Weaver/Innovate.
    *   **Banger Scene:** **Depict Mark Weaver receiving/seeing the challenge** – perhaps during a tense board call. Show his disbelief, rage, and panic as it goes viral.
    *   Rhys Edwards advises Mark strategically – subtly framing the potential PR upside (or downside of appearing weak) and likely manipulating the situation.
    *   Emma/Jules/Connor navigate their new roles, now *reacting* to the escalating public feud. Jules focuses on technical documentation/audits to *refute* IP claims internally. Emma, drawing on past trauma, might offer unsolicited (and ignored?) PR/social media crisis advice.

*   **Chapters 10-12 (Midpoint - Acceptance & Absurd Preparation):**
    *   Mark Weaver, cornered, desperate, and heavily influenced by Rhys's strategic framing (and perhaps Aether-generated sentiment analysis showing potential PR angles), **publicly accepts Jax's boxing challenge.** Use adapted Musk/Zuck-esque posts for the awkward back-and-forth confirmation.
    *   Public and internal reactions explode. Social media becomes central (memes, news coverage, betting odds). Showcase the absurdity through online snippets.
    *   **Banger Scene:** **Derek Miller attempts to apply PEAK methodology to the fight's PR strategy,** proposing "Synergy Sprints for Narrative Velocity," requiring intervention from Sarah/Rhys to prevent further embarrassment.
    *   Focus shifts to the bizarre build-up: Mark's reluctant, possibly comical, training efforts juxtaposed with the Aether team's intense coding "training"; Innovate's official PR team trying to spin the narrative; legal teams likely sidelined or baffled.
    *   Aether development continues, possibly facing new technical hurdles or being subtly steered by Rhys to produce PR wins timed around the fight buzz. **Maybe Aether is used internally to track fight sentiment or find dirt on Jax?** Character arcs (Emma's recovery tested by public stress, Jules leading security audits, Connor finding footing) progress under this strange pressure.

*   **Chapters 13-14 (Climax - The Fight, The Launch, The Downscope):**
    *   **The Fight:** Depict the spectacle of the boxing match. Focus less on the blow-by-blow and more on the *atmosphere*, the social media commentary, the PR spin, and the predicted outcome: Mark, despite likely losing physically, gains public sympathy/respect for having the guts to show up, while Jax comes off looking like an unhinged bully.
    *   **Aether's Triumph:** Timed for maximum impact *immediately* following the fight (leveraging the media attention), Aether achieves its major, undeniable milestone (e.g., stunning public beta launch outperforming Nexus Mind, securing a major client Dataprime lost, releasing a game-changing feature). Rhys ensures the narrative connects Mark's "courage" with Innovate's "fighting spirit" embodied by Aether.
    *   **The "Downscope" Begins:** Riding the wave of positive PR from the fight (Mark as the underdog hero) and Aether's validated success, the major restructuring/layoffs are announced. It's framed as necessary streamlining to focus on proven winners like Aether, capitalizing on the moment of perceived strength.

*   **Chapters 15-16 (Falling Action & Resolution):**
    *   The dust settles. Show the new power structure: Aether and Infrastructure are undeniably central, potentially absorbing more resources/functions. Dataprime's relevance may be diminished.
    *   Resolve the key character arcs: Emma finds sustainable stability and purpose within the successful Aether structure; Jules thrives in his leadership role, respected and balanced; Connor proves his competence within Infrastructure; Rhys oversees his consolidated domain, perhaps planning the *next* strategic move; Mark adapts to his unexpected "fighter CEO" persona; Derek continues his PEAK evangelism in increasing irrelevance.
    *   Final reflections on the absurdity of the journey, the nature of corporate power, the human cost of "optimization," and the future shaped by Aether.
