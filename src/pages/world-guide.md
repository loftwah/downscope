## Communication Platforms & Protocols

### Official Company Channels

- Slack: Primary company-wide communication
  - Public channels: #general, #announcements
  - **Former** Team channels: **#team-catalyst (now defunct/archived), #team-nexus (likely minimal activity)**, #infra-ops
  - Project channels: **#aether-feedback (public facing), Project PEAK channels (created by Derek)**
  - Ad-hoc channels created and abandoned frequently
- Jira: Official project management and ticketing
  - Strictly enforced by Product teams (Victor's domain, **now less central post-restructuring**)
  - Largely bypassed by Infra for core work (except performative visibility)
  - **Used heavily and dysfunctionally for PEAK initiative under Derek.**
- Zoom: All synchronous meetings and presentations
  - Weekly standups, planning sessions, demos
  - Quarterly all-hands meetings
  - Performance reviews and 1:1s (**including PIP meetings**)
- Email: Formal communications and documentation
  - Increasingly replaced by Slack for daily interaction
  - Still used for HR communications, legal, external contacts, **and major company announcements (restructuring).**

### Shadow IT & Backchannels

- Signal: Used exclusively for sensitive communications
  - Rhys and Max's coordination, strategic discussions.
  - **Used by Sarah for sensitive updates to core Infra team (e.g., post-Victor death).**
  - Conversations requiring plausible deniability or operating outside official oversight.
- **Private Slack Channels:**
  - `#project-carry-derek`: Used by Infra (and now Jules, Jesse) for monitoring and coordinating containment of Derek Miller. Highly restricted. **Archived end of Ch 5.** _(Note: Ch 5 describes its decommissioning, so its status is 'Archived')._
  - `#aether-core-team`: Used by the ring-fenced Aether development team, restricted access enforced by Infra. **Primary channel for Aether dev.**
- Notion: Unofficial documentation and planning
  - Derek's personal project documentation (PEAK, mesh security diagrams).
  - Team-specific knowledge bases bypassing official wikis.
- Personal GitHub repos: Early prototyping before official projects.
- WhatsApp/Telegram: Informal team communications, gossip, venting.
- **Dark Web Forums / Tor Browser:** Used briefly by Emma during crisis (Ch 4), accessing illicit marketplaces/services. **Significant source of internal conflict/ambiguity for her until resolution in Ch 5.**
- **Encrypted Bitcoin Wallet (Electrum mentioned):** Used by Emma for dark web transaction (Ch 4).

## Corporate Structures & Power Dynamics

### Official Hierarchy

- Mark (CEO) → Greg (CTO) → Rhys (Head of Engineering) → Max (Principal Infra), Sarah (Senior SRE), Eli (Senior Systems Engineer), **Jules (Senior Engineer)**, Jesse (Junior Engineer)
- Mark (CEO) → **Derek (Head of Product - title only)** → **Emma (Product Strategy Lead, Aether - dotted line)**
- **Team Catalyst and Team Nexus effectively dissolved/absorbed by restructuring (Ch 6).**
- Department siloes **significantly weakened by restructuring**, with Infra absorbing key technical functions related to Aether.
- Quarterly OKRs likely still exist but heavily influenced by Aether's perceived success and strategic importance.

### Shadow Hierarchy & Team Dynamics

- Rhys operates with **near-total autonomy** on Aether, leveraging Greg's deference and Mark's direct mandate. Uses information control and strategic alliances masterfully. **Power consolidated.**
- Max remains Rhys's primary technical execution lead, operating within Rhys's strategic framework. Influence through technical mastery.
- Derek retains HoP title but has **lost direct technical oversight** and functional authority post-restructuring. His influence is largely performative, managed via Rhys/Greg. Still contained by PCD (until its decommissioning end Ch 5).
- Jules has **successfully transitioned** into Infrastructure/Aether core team, recognized for competence and discretion. Influence growing within technical sphere.
- **Emma** has been **functionally integrated** into the Aether team, providing critical product insight under Infra's direction, reporting dotted-line to Derek. Her influence tied to Aether's success.
- **Infrastructure Team Culture:** Operates distinctly. Values deep work, sustained concentration. Employs cyclical operating model (sprint/recovery). Prioritizes technical excellence and operational stability. **Utilizes WeWork for weekly synchronous collaboration.** Extensive use of internal tools/shadow systems (PCD decommissioned end Ch 5). **Strong internal cohesion and rituals (Pixel Pioneers).**

### Information Flow

- Official updates often lack substantive truth (**especially regarding restructuring, Aether control**).
- Real decisions/coordination for Aether/Infra happen in private channels (Signal, `#aether-core-team`).
- Technical truth in code, config, dashboards; **narrative fiction dominates executive updates and broader comms (PEAK, Aether marketing).**
- Credit assigned strategically by Rhys; blame deflected or absorbed lower down (Connor).
- Visibility remains crucial outside Infra; within Infra, competence and delivery are paramount.

## Tech Industry Context (2025)

### Market Conditions

- Post-AI bubble correction period: Increased scrutiny on AI project ROI.
- VC funding drought: Pressure for profitability/stable revenue.
- Immense pressure to demonstrate AI value.
- Competitors rapidly mimicking features (Dataprime confirmed threat).
- Industry-wide layoffs disguised as "strategic realignments." **Looming threat confirmed driver for Rhys's strategy and Mark's decisions.**

### Technology Trends

- RAG and protocols like MCP common for enterprise AI.
- Cloud cost optimization is critical.
- Privacy regulations create significant compliance burdens.
- Open-source LLMs offer alternatives.

### Work Culture

- **Remote-first policy formally implemented at Innovate Solutions (Ch 3).** Reliance on digital tools. **Infra uses weekly WeWork sessions for synchronous collaboration.**
- Performance metrics potentially automated/analyzed.
- "Doing more with less" mantra prevails.
- Career advancement tied heavily to visibility, strategic alignment, politics (outside Infra). **Restructuring demonstrates ruthless focus on perceived value.**
- Digital presence shapes perception. **Isolation is a significant risk of remote model (Emma's experience).**

## Key Technical Concepts in Story

### Aether's Core Functionality

Aether integrates with company systems via MCP to provide contextual intelligence. It can:

- Predict customer retention risk (**demonstrated tangible $1.7M ARR save - Ch 5**).
- Generate personalized communication strategies/actions.
- Identify cross-sell/upsell opportunities.
- Automate/enhance support responses (**ticket routing efficiency up 28% - Ch 5**).
- Provide actionable competitive intelligence (**Ch 5**).
- Continuously learn from new data.

### Jules's Critical Contribution (STS Ephemeral Session Broker)

The Python authentication wrapper Jules created:

- Provides secure, temporary (~15-min TTL), audited access across AWS services/accounts.
- Uses STS `GetSessionToken` + `AssumeRole` with dynamic inline IAM policies.
- Enforces least privilege for each request.
- Maintains comprehensive CloudTrail logs via `SourceIdentity`.
- Allows Aether to query production data sources securely.
- **Enhancement (Phase 2 - Ch 5):** Implemented token caching (**LRFU cache mentioned**) reducing latency by **~68%**, with proactive invalidation mechanism (**two-phase commit planned**).

### Project Carry Derek (PCD)

A highly sophisticated, undocumented internal system developed and maintained by Infra to manage Derek Miller's technical risks.

- **Function:** Monitored, intercepted, simulated Derek's interactions with critical systems.
- **Mechanism:** Used custom proxy layer, dynamic sandboxes, simulated responses. Logged averted incidents.
- **Purpose:** Allowed Derek perceived contribution without causing damage. Balanced politics/stability.
- **Access:** Knowledge limited to core Infra (Rhys, Max, Sarah, Eli) and later Jules, Jesse.
- **Ethical Complexity:** Operated on "benevolent containment" philosophy.
- **Status:** **Successfully DECOMMISSIONED end of Chapter 5** after Derek's promotion structurally removed the primary risk vector. Archived logs retained.

### Max's Technical Domain

Max's expertise spans critical areas for Aether and PCD:

- Cloud infrastructure orchestration (AWS ECS/Fargate, Lambda, RDS, Kafka; Terraform; Kubernetes).
- AI model deployment (Bedrock, Claude) and optimization (RAG pipelines, prompt engineering).
- High-performance distributed systems design (microservices, Kafka, Redis).
- Security architecture and implementation.
- Real-time monitoring, alerting, and observability systems.

### Rhys's Strategic Vision for Aether

Rhys sees Aether evolving into:

- An autonomous operational intelligence platform executing automated actions.
- A system potentially replacing/augmenting roles (support, AM, PM).
- A core competitive advantage, placing Infra at the strategic center.
- A powerful demonstration of his leadership, positioning him for advancement.
- **A "lifeboat"**: Proven indispensable value securing Infra's future amidst restructuring.

## Character-Technology Relationships

### Max & Stimulants

- Uses dexamphetamine methodically for peak cognitive focus during **defined high-intensity sprints** (hackathon, Aether Phase Two).
- Dosing is precise, calculated, managed alongside cannabis use to mitigate side effects.
- **Cyclical Use:** Aligned with Infra's sprint/recovery operational rhythm. Not constant.
- Enables extraordinary productivity Rhys leverages; viewed by Max as necessary tool.

### Jules & Visibility

- **Transition Complete:** Fully moved from invisible contributor to recognized technical asset within Infrastructure. Invitation to core team, auth system ownership, PCD knowledge confirm this shift.
- **Recognition Achieved (within Infra):** Acknowledged by Max, Rhys, Sarah for STS wrapper and discretion. Co-authorship, direct reporting line solidify standing.
- **Navigating Demands:** Successfully asserting ability to meet Infra's intensity within his boundaries. Mentoring Connor shows growing confidence/influence.

### Rhys & Control Systems

- Uses technology as instruments of creation (Aether) and control (PCD - now decommissioned, communication segmentation, monitoring).
- Manipulates narratives (crediting Max) and leverages information (monitoring) for strategic advantage.
- Segments communication across platforms strategically.
- Applies security/access controls to maintain information advantages (shielding Aether).
- Creates technical dependencies (Aether) to ensure team relevance/power.
- Builds/utilizes shadow systems (PCD - historical, private monitoring - ongoing). Implicitly leveraged Max's stimulant use.

### Derek & Perception Management

- Masters tools of visibility (Jira under PEAK, Slack, Zoom, Notion, PowerPoint). Technical "contributions" were simulated/contained by PCD (until Ch 5 end).
- Curates narratives positively, misrepresenting technical reality (PEAK success).
- Positions himself to associate with success (Aether).
- Uses technical jargon confidently but incorrectly.
- Captures perceived credit through communication/documentation.
- Relies on title/performative engagement. Unaware of PCD history. **Functionally sidelined post-restructuring.**

### Emma & Recovery/Technology

- **Trajectory:** Post-crisis (Ch 4/5), actively pursuing recovery (therapy, family reconnection). Found professional stability in Aether role (Ch 6). **Recalibrated relationship with alcohol, moving away from strict abstinence towards managed control (Ch 6).**
- **Current State:** Functioning effectively professionally, highly valued by Infra. Masking internal state less, engaging more tentatively. Still fragile but trajectory positive.
- **Visibility:** Observed by Rhys/Sarah as valuable but requiring monitoring. Supported subtly by Jules.
- **Tech Relationship:** Using Aether work as positive focus. Relationship with personal tech (phone, past use of dark web/crypto) remains linked to trauma but less actively haunting post-resolution of Victor ambiguity.
