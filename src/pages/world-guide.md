## Corporate Structures & Power Dynamics

**Official Hierarchy**

- Mark (CEO) → Greg (CTO) → Rhys (Head of Engineering) → Max (Principal Infra)
- Mark (CEO) → Victor (Head of Product) → Emma (PM) / Derek (Team Lead)
- Department siloes with limited cross-functional integration
- Quarterly OKRs that shift frequently based on market panic

**Shadow Hierarchy**

- Rhys operates with near-autonomy, leveraging Greg's technical deference
- Max functions as Rhys's deputy across official boundaries
- Derek navigates political currents to attach himself to power centers
- Jules contributes critical work while remaining functionally invisible
- Amir maintains influence through historical knowledge and quiet competence

**Information Flow**

- Official updates flow through formal channels but carry minimal substance
- Real decisions happen in private channels, DMs, and off-record meetings
- Technical truth exists in code repositories while narrative fiction dominates meetings
- Credit flows upward; blame flows downward
- Visibility trumps actual contribution for advancement

## Tech Industry Context (2025)

**Market Conditions**

- Post-AI bubble correction period
- VC funding drought after earlier overinvestment
- Pressure to demonstrate AI-driven value to investors
- Competitors rapidly mimicking successful features
- Industry-wide layoffs disguised as "strategic realignments"

**Technology Trends**

- AI has moved from novelty to expected infrastructure
- RAG and MCP have become standard for enterprise AI implementations
- Cloud cost optimization as important as feature development
- Privacy regulations creating compliance burdens
- Open-source alternatives threatening commercial models

**Work Culture**

- Remote-first with occasional "collaboration days" in shared spaces
- Performance metrics increasingly automated and AI-analyzed
- "Doing more with less" as universal management mantra
- Career advancement tied to visibility more than capability
- Physical workspace replaced by digital presence

## Key Technical Concepts in Story

**Aether's Core Functionality**
Aether integrates with all company systems to provide contextual intelligence across data silos. It can:

- Analyze customer interaction patterns to predict retention risk
- Generate personalized communication strategies based on historical interactions
- Identify cross-selling opportunities using patterns invisible to human analysts
- Automate routine support responses with customer-specific context
- Continuously learn from new interactions to improve recommendations

**Jules's Critical Contribution**
The authentication wrapper Jules created solves a fundamental security challenge for Aether:

- Provides secure, temporary, audited access across system boundaries
- Implements just-in-time privilege escalation with automatic expiration
- Creates fine-grained permission scopes for precise data access
- Maintains comprehensive audit logs for compliance
- Allows Aether to query sensitive data without permanent elevated access

**Max's Technical Domain**
Max's expertise spans multiple critical areas:

- Cloud infrastructure orchestration (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes)
- AI model deployment and optimization
- High-performance distributed systems
- Security architecture and implementation
- Real-time monitoring and alerting systems

**Rhys's Strategic Vision for Aether**
Beyond the initial implementation, Rhys sees Aether evolving into:

- An autonomous agent platform that can execute actions, not just recommend them
- A system that could potentially replace significant portions of customer-facing roles
- A competitive advantage that places Infra at the center of the company's future
- A showcase for his technical leadership that could position him for CTO or beyond

## Character-Technology Relationships

**Max & Stimulants**

- Uses dexamphetamine (Adderall/dexies) methodically to maintain inhuman focus and output
- Dosing is precise and calculated, using pharmacy-grade pills in 5-10mg amounts
- Takes multiple tablets simultaneously (15-30mg) for extended coding sessions
- Consumption coincides with Rhys's expectations and deadlines
- Dry-swallows pills to minimize disruption to workflow
- Maintains supplies carefully, tracking consumption against project timelines
- Stimulant use enables the superhuman productivity that Rhys values and exploits

**Jules & Visibility**

- Creates elegant, critical technical solutions with minimal acknowledgment
- Documents thoroughly but in places few people read or reference
- Commits code with clear comments that get overlooked in demos and presentations
- Takes on essential "plumbing" work that enables flashier features
- Lacks the strategic language to translate technical contribution to business value
- Remains invisible in the Slack-performance-theater that dominates recognition

**Rhys & Control Systems**

- Uses technology as instruments of both creation and control
- Manipulates logging systems and metrics to support desired narratives
- Segments communication across platforms based on deniability needs
- Applies security controls selectively to maintain information advantages
- Creates technical dependencies that ensure his continued importance
- Builds "backdoors" into systems for monitoring and intervention

**Derek & Perception Management**

- Masters the tools of visibility (Jira, Slack, Zoom) rather than technical depth
- Curates metrics and dashboards that showcase team output as personal success
- Positions himself at key presentation moments to maximize association with success
- Uses technical language without technical understanding
- Captures credit through strategic meeting participation and documentation
- Creates dependency relationships through process control rather than knowledge

## AI in the Workplace (2025)

**Daily AI Integration**

- ChatGPT/Claude used routinely for drafting emails, Slack messages, documentation
- GitHub Copilot and similar tools for code assistance now standard
- AI meeting summaries and action item extraction for all synchronous communications
- Automated performance analytics based on system interaction patterns
- AI-suggested career development paths based on skill gaps

**The Human-AI Boundary**

- Increasing anxiety about which roles remain "AI-proof"
- Shift from "AI will help humans" to "humans assist AI" in certain domains
- New job categories emerging as AI handlers and prompt engineers
- Growing divide between those who can direct AI effectively and those who can't
- Ethical questions about disclosure of AI-generated work largely ignored

**Anthropic's Claude in the Company**

- Enterprise license allows unlimited usage across departments
- Specialized Claude instances fine-tuned for company-specific tasks
- Widespread reliance on Claude for communication drafting creating homogenized voice
- Internal jokes about "That sounds like Claude wrote it" when detecting AI text
- Growing dependency on Claude for institutional knowledge as documentation lags

## Environmental Details

**Remote Work Environments**

- Jules: Cluttered home office with kid's drawings, family photos, dated equipment
