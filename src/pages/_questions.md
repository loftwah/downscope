**"DOWNSCOPE" - Chapter 7 Planning Questions**

**I. Chapter 7 Focus & Arc:**

1.  **Central Theme:** What is the primary feeling or theme of this chapter? (e.g., Mounting Pressure, Public Spectacle Begins, Escalation Point, The Gauntlet Thrown)
2.  **Key Plot Point:** What is the single most significant plot development _that occurs within this chapter_? (Likely Jax issuing the challenge).
3.  **Opening Scene:** How will you immediately establish the _increased_ tension from the Dataprime feud compared to the end of Chapter 6? (e.g., Start with Mark reacting to a new, more aggressive tweet from Jax? Show Aether team discussing a potential Dataprime probing attempt?)
4.  **Closing Scene/Hook:** How will the chapter end _immediately_ after the challenge is issued? (e.g., Focus on Mark Weaver's stunned reaction? Rhys making a calculated call to Mark? The social media explosion just beginning?)
5.  **Working Title for Chapter 7?** (e.g., "Escalation Protocol," "Trial by Twitter," "The Challenge," "Coneheads & Combat")

**II. Plot - The Feud Intensifies:**

6.  **Aether Success & Optics:**
    - Does Aether achieve a specific success in this chapter? If so, what is it?
    - Crucially, how does Rhys/Sarah ensure this success _doesn't_ leak publicly, or if it does, how is it framed to mitigate Jax's IP claims _before_ the challenge?
7.  **Jax's Escalation (Pre-Challenge):**
    - Show _at least one specific example_ of Jax escalating his public attacks on X/Twitter this chapter. What tactic does he use (mocking tech, sharing vague "evidence," directly insulting Mark)?
    - Who are Jax's key lieutenants amplifying his message online? Give them a brief moment.
8.  **The Challenge:**
    - **What is the _exact_ wording (adapted) of the tweet/post where Jax issues the boxing challenge?** Make it memorable and tie it explicitly to the IP dispute.
    - What platform does he use? Is it just text, or is there a video component?
9.  **Underlying Truth (Optional Beat):** Is there a brief moment where someone internally (maybe Jules, maybe even Rhys privately) considers if there _is_ any accidental similarity or if Jax is purely grandstanding?
10. **Aether Under Pressure:**
    - What specific technical task is the Aether team focused on _while_ this external drama unfolds? (e.g., Security hardening _because_ of Dataprime, scaling challenges, integrating Emma's insights?)
    - Show a brief moment of the team reacting to the external noise â€“ does it distract, annoy, or motivate them?

**III. Plot - Internal Ripples & Online Battlefield:**

11. **Connor's View:** Show Connor reacting to one of Jax's public accusations against Aether. Does he mention it to Jules? Does it make him question the project, or reinforce his loyalty to his new team?
12. **Derek's Input (or Lack Thereof):** Does Derek make any attempt to comment on the feud (perhaps internally) using PEAK jargon? How is he managed/ignored?
13. **Social Media Engagement:**
    - **Max's Role:** Does Max engage Jax _before_ the challenge? **Does the "Max vs. Sterling Vance" Conehead scene happen in _this_ chapter?** If so, how does it fit into the timeline?
    - **Jesse's Role:** How does Jesse get drawn into the online fray _this chapter_? Does he post an explainer video? Does he get attacked? How does Sarah/Max react?
    - **Sarah's Role:** Does Sarah post anything subtly relevant (e.g., about engineering stability vs. hype)?
    - **Public Snippets:** Include 1-2 brief examples of online reactions (Hacker News comments, replies on X/Twitter) to Jax's escalating attacks _before_ the challenge drops.

**IV. Character Development:**

14. **Jules:**
    - Show Jules actively working on the security audit/documentation intended to counter IP claims. What specific action does he take?
    - How does he _personally react_ when he sees Jax's public provocations, knowing his own code is implicitly involved? Is it quiet fury, determination, or resignation?
15. **Emma:**
    - Show Emma reacting to the online chaos. Does it trigger anxiety about her _own_ past social media disaster? Does she successfully use her _new_ coping mechanisms (writing?) to process it?
    - Does she offer any specific, practical PR or strategic advice _internally_ based on her experience? Is it heard?
16. **Rhys:**
    - Show Rhys monitoring the situation. How does he leverage Jax's aggression _internally_ within this chapter (e.g., in a brief interaction with Greg or Mark _before_ the challenge)?
    - What is his immediate, calculated reaction _when_ the challenge drops (if shown)? Does he immediately contact Mark?
17. **Max:**
    - Show Max balancing intense Aether work with the external provocations. Is he more annoyed by the distraction or energized by the fight? Does the pressure affect his reliance on performance aids?
18. **Mark Weaver:**
    - Depict Mark dealing with the _escalating_ IP accusations _before_ the challenge. Show his stress and frustration.
    - Focus the end of the chapter on his immediate, raw reaction _to_ the challenge itself.

**V. "Banger" Scenes & Pacing:**

19. **Which specific "banger" scenes will you include in Chapter 7?**
    - The Phishing Sim Incident?
    - Max vs. Sterling Vance (Coneheads)?
    - Max's public technical takedown of Jax (pre-challenge)?
    - Emma writing as a coping mechanism?
    - The public issuance of the challenge itself?
    - Mark's immediate reaction to the challenge?
20. **Pacing Check:** Does the chapter build tension effectively towards the challenge? Are there enough peaks and valleys (banger scenes vs. quieter character moments)? Does it feel like a cohesive part of the "Escalation" arc?

This focused set of questions should help you map out the specific events, character beats, and impactful scenes needed to make Chapter 7 a compelling part of the rising action leading into the chaos of the fight acceptance and preparation.
